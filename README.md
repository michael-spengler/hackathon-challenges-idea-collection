## Hacktoberfest Hackathon - October 23rd 2020
On October 23rd, we would like to try a new concept for inspiring and successful regular collaboration - **Deno Module Hackathons**

If it turns out to be a fun and successful event, we will schedule **Deno Hackathons** on a regular basis.

We will organize this event via the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hYUsX3H) of the [Nest.land Community](https://nest.land/)

Feel free to join via the following invitation link: https://discord.gg/hYUsX3H  

If you have not published a Deno module yet, build and publish one on https://nest.land/ and on https://deno.land/x.

The kickoff event will take place as an online event starting at **12 PM [EDT] (4pm UTC) (https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/new-york)**.  

We're looking forward to meeting you and developing something **awesome** together.


# Topic Proposals

## Build a Deno module
Complete a Deno module and publish it to Nest.land **and** Deno.land/x. 

Extra points will be awarded to modules that meet the following criteria:
- Complete or leverage [web3](https://nest.land/package/web3)
- Complete or leverage [nlp](https://nest.land/package/nlp)
- Build a canvas module for Deno

## Boy Scout Tour (nament) :)
Pick any Nest.land or Deno.land/x module you like and leave it in better condition than you found it by raising a **beneficial** PR on its repository.
