# The Plan

## Agenda
1. 1 PM German Time: SAP Employee development kickoff
2. 12 PM EST: Hacktoberfest Event - Deno & Profit Sharing Communities
  - Tate, Ryan, Sam, Michael
3. Start hacktoberfesting!

## Hacktoberfest Hackathon - October 23rd 2020
On October 23rd, we would like to try a new concept for inspiring and successful regular collaboration - **Deno Module Hackathons**

If it turns out to be a fun and successful event, we will schedule **Deno Hackathons** on a regular basis.

We will organize this event via the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hYUsX3H) of the [Nest.land Community](https://nest.land/)

Feel free to join via the following invitation link: https://discord.gg/hYUsX3H  

If you did not publish any Deno module yet, just go for it and publish a new, useful module on https://nest.land/ and on https://deno.land/x.

The kickoff event will take place as an online event starting at **12 PM [EST] (https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/new-york)**.  

We're looking forward to meeting you and developing something awesome together.


# Topic Proposals

## Build a Deno module
Complete a Deno module and publish it to Nest.land **and** Deno.land/x. 

## Start your own fully decentralized Profit Sharing Community
For Enterprise Context: Might be helpful as an additional "go-to-market" / "community growing" experiment): https://github.com/michael-spengler/profit-sharing-communities

## Boy Scout Tour (nament) :)
Pick any Nest.land or Deno.land/x module you like and leave it in better condition than you found it by raising a **beneficial** PR on its repository.

# Enterprises
**Why shall "classical" enterprises support regular open source deno hackathons?**
1. Provide opportunities for employees for efficient and fun mutual education for promising new technologies
2. Attract potential future employees
