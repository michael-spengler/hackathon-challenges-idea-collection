## Agenda Proposal
1. 1pm german time: Intro (Tate, Sam, Cedrik?, Michael)
2. All you can code

## Hackathons - Dry Run on October 23rd 2020
On October 23rd we would like to try a new concept for inspiring and successful regular collaboration - **Deno Hackathons**   

If it turns out to be a fun and successful event, we will schedule **Deno Hackathons** on a regular basis.

We will organize this event via the discord server of the https://nest.land/ community  

Feel free to join via the following invitation link: https://discord.gg/hYUsX3H  

If you did not publish any Deno module yet, just go for it and publish a new, useful module on https://nest.land/ and on https://deno.land/x.

The event will take place as an online event starting at **1pm [german time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/germany/berlin)**.  

We're looking forward to meet you and to develop something awesome together.

# Enterprises
**Why shall "classical" enterprises support regular open source deno hackathons?**
1. Provide opportunities for employees for efficient and fun mutual education for promising new technologies
2. Attract potential future employees 

# Ideas
